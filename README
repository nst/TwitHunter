TwitHunter is an attempt to see how scoring could be useful in a Twitter client.

By scoring, I mean setting up rules that increase or descrease the score of individual tweets.

You can then filter the tweets and display only the ones with the highest score.

So far, it us just a quick hack, but it works :-)

If the data model changes (and it will) delete ~/Library/Application\ Support/TwitHunter/TwitHunter.xml and relaunch.
